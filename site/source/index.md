# Adithya "Adi" Yerramsetty

## Who am I?
My name's Adi, and I'm a computer science student at ASU.
My work/research/main interests include
Monocular Visual SLAM, NeRFs, and other core
topics in Computer Vision, Robotics and Machine Learning.

Outside of these core interests of mine, I find most of 
CS and Math interesting, and so there might be pages on this site related
to various topics like data structures, principles of OS design
and backend design.

## What do I do?
Apart from being a student, I currently serve as president of ASU's
Machine Learning Club, where I was previously the Head of Content; regardless of position, I'm mainly repsonsible for developing technical content and giving
tutorials on cool topics in Machine Learning. Definitely check out our good work over there if you have time!

Beyond this, I somewhat unofficially work with ASU's DREAM Lab and Jnaneshwar Das, mainly working towards research in scene representations, which I work with via monocular SLAM, NeRFs and Occupancy Networks. Some related projects of mine are available on this site, so definitely check those out!

## Contact Info
The most reliable way to get in touch with me is probably my LinkedIn, which is linked [here.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adithya-yerramsetty) I prefer this over e-mail due to a) being less formal and b) allowing blocking of spam contacts and being less spammy overall.

My ASU email is ayerrams@asu.edu
