# Cool Topics in Ongoing Research
At any point, there are a huge number of topics
being researched in the ML+CV+Robotics communities. There
is some small subset of these that I find really interesting
and important, so I'll go over them here. If you ever want
to talk about any of these, feel free to reach out; I always
enjoy talking to people about cool new topics in the field.

## Fast Monocular SLAM

## Occupancy Networks

## NeRFs and 3D rendering
